# üìò Project Documentation (React + TypeScript + Vite)

## üåê Live Demo

The application is deployed on GitHub Pages:  
üëâ [movies-app](https://alexandermezhenskyi.github.io/movies-app)

## üöÄ Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the following command in the root directory to install all libraries defined in `package.json`:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**  
   Launch the Vite development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR):

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   After startup, the app will be available at the URL shown in the terminal ([http://localhost:5173/movies-app](http://localhost:5173/movies-app/)).

3. **Build for Production**  
   Create an optimized production build:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

   The build output will be located in the `dist` directory.

4. **Preview Production Build Locally**  
   Serve the built application locally to test the production version:
   ```bash
   yarn preview
   ```
